										<h1>Evaluation of the final project (Unit 11) vs. the initial proposal (Unit 6)</h1>

										   <h3><strong>Project Report Objective</strong></h3>
										   <p>The objective of the first project report required me and my team to position us as IT Software Consultants and Developers, to design, build, and present a logical database for a chosen area of interest in a work environment or public service. You'll produce a detailed design report encompassing various aspects:</p>

										   <ul>
										   <li>
 										     <strong>Logical Design:</strong> It should depict data items/entities, their attributes, relationships, and associations. The selected data types and formats should be explained.
 										   </li>
 										   <li>
										      <strong>Data Management Pipeline Process:</strong> Critically evaluate this process. Discuss the data used, its sources, and the implemented data cleaning techniques, outlining the stages performed during the cleaning process.
										   </li>
 										   <li>
										      <strong>Database Build Proposal:</strong> Create a database model design for the proposed build. The choice of the database management system should take into consideration storage needs, user access, and data manipulation and retrieval.
  										  </li>
 										  </ul>

										  <h3><strong>Choice of Area and Design:</strong></h3>
										  <p>We opted for a Hotel Management System (HMS) design for Dreamland Manor which aimed at enhancing operational efficiency, decision-making capabilities, and service quality. Since hotels manage a vast amount of data from various sources, such as guest information, room occupancy, services, inventory, staff details, and financial transactions, an effective HMS database facilitates efficient access, storage, and management, improving service and operations.</p>
										  <p>The proposed database design ensures data integrity, security, and scalability for future growth. By strategically structuring data items, their attributes, and relationships, the HMS provides comprehensive insights into hotel operations, supporting decision-making and personalized guest experiences.</p>

										  <h3><strong>Brief of comments received:</strong></h3>
 										  <p>The report demonstrates strong knowledge and understanding of the topic, but it leans more towards theory without a balanced representation of practical application. To enhance the quality, theoretical knowledge should be coherently tied to the hotel management database design. The data management pipeline should better reflect the application by explaining how theoretical understanding informed the design process. A more seamless connection between requirements and design sections is needed. Critical analysis is reasonable, but more critical thinking is needed when linking theory to practice and evaluating design options, particularly in sections 3 and 4.</p>

 										 <h3><strong>Evaluation:</strong></h3>
										 <p>While working on the executive summary report, we prioritized: the balance between theory and practice, and the application of the data management pipeline.</p>
 										 <p>We understood that it is important to apply these principles effectively in a real-world context. In our case, we're dealing with a hotel management database. We used these principles to have informed the structure of your database, linking abstract concepts with tangible outcomes.</p>
 										 <p><strong>Application of Data Management Pipeline:</strong> Another critical aspect to emphasize is the implementation of the data management pipeline within the context of your hotel management database. This involves detailing the steps in the data management pipeline processes, such as data capture, cleaning, and storage, ensure accuracy and reliability as the right database management system selection plays a pivotal role in the HMS's performance, considering factors like storage requirements, user access, and data manipulation and retrieval.</p>
