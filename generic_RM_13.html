									<p>Machine learning is a powerful tool for gleaning knowledge from massive amounts of data (Breck., et al, 2023). Machine learning is increasingly prevalent in business, with 67% of companies using it and 97% planning to use it in the next year, according to a 2020 Deloitte survey. Aleksander Madry, head of the MIT Centre for Deployable Machine Learning stated that "Machine learning is changing, or will change, every industry, and leaders must understand the fundamental principles, potential, and limitations". </p>
									<p>Throughout this module, I have amassed a vast range of knowledge and understanding of machine learning, greatly enhancing my expertise in this domain. After the introduction to machine learning, we were introduced to the Exploratory Data Analysis and pre-processing part. Unit 2 which consisted of the EDA made me understand the importance of describing, summarizing, and visualising the structure of the data before starting to the preprocessing and modelling part. This foundational knowledge was pivotal as I transitioned to Unit 3 and Unit 4, where I explored the nuances of correlation and Regression using utilizing Scikit-Learn, grasping the essential relationships between variables through heatmaps.</p>
									<p>Unit 4 to Unit 6 consisted of the traditional machine learning models and techniques. The focus of unit 4 was the utilization of Scikit-Learn to implement Linear Regression models which provided me with a better understanding of predictors and their respective effects. This was a constructive and beneficial practical experience that allowed me to bridge theoretical understanding with real-world application. Unit 5 and 6 introduced me to the realm of Clustering, and I was fascinated by how data points can be grouped based on intrinsic similarities. The animation of the clustering in that Unit was an eye opener as it made me visualise how the boundaries evolve and how the algorithm iterates. It played a great role in helping me understand the clustering process conceptually. Also, unit 6 provided me with a hands-on approach of clustering in python where I got the opportunity to apply clustering algorithms, segmenting data into insightful clusters. Additionally, the silhouette method was a valuable tool, offering a visual perspective on determining the best number of clusters suitable for our dataset.</p>
									<p>The next phase of my learning journey was Deep Learning and Advanced Modelling, covered in units 7 through 10. Unit 7 provided me with a clear introduction of the architecture of ANNs and the methodologies behind training them, offering insights into the building blocks of deep learning. This foundation was further solidified in Units 9 and 10 where I was introduced to the specialized domain of Convolutional Neural Networks, exploring their unique architecture and diving into interactive learning sessions that enriched my understanding of image data processing. The interactive session was pivotal as it provided a holistic and integrated model overview that concisely summarises the structure of a CNN and thereby allowed me to grasp the structure and the underlying rationale of the model as it was presented it in an intuitive and visually appealing format.</p>
									<p>Lastly, unit 11 was a fundamental as it emphasized the significance of Model Selection and Evaluation. It underlined the importance of not just building models, but ensuring they are robust, reliable, and ready for use in the real-world implication.</p>
									<p>Through this module, each unit presented its own set of fascinating concepts and challenges. For me, one of the most interesting parts of this module was the exploration of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The concept and algorithms used to be able to discern, classify, and even recreate intricate patterns in image data is a testament to the advancements in the field. Understanding the multi-layered architecture of CNNs and witnessing their prowess in real-world application was enlightening.</p>
									<p>However, despite Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs being the fascinating in my journey in this module, it brought its own set of challenges. Even though, the ability and power of the CNNs models were captivating, the underlying algorithms were very complex and took me a lot of time and focus to be able to understand the underlying mechanics.  Furthermore, the significance and the use of the activation functions in preserving non-linearity and the tuning of hyper-parameters, were initially overwhelming and required a lot of experimentation. Also, the rigorous timelines and the relentless pace of learning throughout this module added to the pressure.</p>
									<p>As a data analyst working in the hospitality sector, the tools and techniques learned throughout this module offers a myriad of opportunities. The foundational principles of Exploratory Data Analysis will help me in cleaning and deciphering vast datasets like concerning the guests in our hotels such as guest characteristics, guest reviews and the characteristics of the employees in our hotels too. Additionally, use Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks will allow me to go to the further mile as it will help me forecast occupancy rates, devise dynamic pricing strategies, and even tailor experiences to diverse guest demographics. The power of clustering will allow for nuanced guest segmentation, ensuring personalized experiences, while the crucial use of Model Selection and Evaluation will ensure that the data models are robust and efficient which is critical for real-time service optimization in bustling tourist hubs. </p>
									<p>Furthermore, the intersection of Industry 4.0 with Machine Learning highlights the forthcoming future and how the industry is evolving. It inspired me to look for the implication of Industry 4.0 in the hospitality sector and lead me to interesting discoveries such as smart hotels, IoT-enhanced guest experiences, and real-time analytics, painting a promising picture of Mauritius's hospitality sector's future. This holistic learning journey has not only fortified my theoretical understanding but has also enriched my practical application toolkit, ensuring data-driven excellence in my hospitality endeavour.</p>
									<p>This machine learning module offered me a comprehensive understanding of the field of machine learning, covering all the foundational topics. It combines theoretical concepts with practical applications, emphasizing the real-world relevance of tools and techniques. The convergence of traditional machine learning techniques with Industry 4.0 paradigms highlights the field's evolution and future trajectory. The knowledge gained is not just theoretical but a toolkit for real-world scenarios, such as the hospitality sector in Mauritius, which can benefit from data-driven strategies. This module has been a pivotal journey for me, and I'm eagerly looking forward to integrating these learnings into my professional endeavours.</p>
