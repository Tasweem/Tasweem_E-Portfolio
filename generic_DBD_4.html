                                                                                 <p>All data analysis and machine learning projects must include the stages of data collection, cleaning, and parsing as they are important steps in the data management process. However, they can be laborious, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Because of this, a lot of data specialists use automation tools or scripts as automating data cleaning and automating data collection can significantly streamline the data management process and improve efficiency and reliability. (Frost & Sullivan, 2018)</p>

                                                                                   <p>The automation of data cleaning can be done through scheduled web scraping scripts using BeautifulSoup or Scrapy in Python to automatically extract data from websites and leverage APIs for data retrieval.</p>

                                                                                   <p>The automation of data cleaning can be done by writing data cleaning scripts using programming languages like Python, R, or SQL. Also, a machine learning (ML) approach can be created in Python to automate the financial dataset cleaning. This includes ingesting data, addressing incomplete data, addressing anomalies, one-hot wrapping, and label encoding, extracting date and time values, and data normalization. (Oladipupo, 2023). Then the data cleaning scripts are scheduled to run on a regular basis. This ensures that new data is cleaned as soon as it is acquired, or that existing datasets are kept up to date.</p>

                                                                                   <p>The article mentioned in this unit was very interesting. Datanami's 2019 article discusses data pipeline automation's significance in DataOps, addressing challenges in managing large volumes of data and enhancing productivity through streamlined workflows.</p>
