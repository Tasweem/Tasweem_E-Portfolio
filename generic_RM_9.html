										<h1> &#10021;Unit 9: Analysing Qualitative Data </h1>
										<h3>Outcomes from the Team Exercises and activites</h3>
									</header>

										<p>The aim of Unit 9: Analysing Qualitative Data is providing an understanding of the methodologies for analysing qualitative data, acknowledging its inherent interpretative challenges and bias potential. This unit emphasizes the distinct nature of qualitative versus quantitative analysis, introduces coding as a critical step in categorizing data from sources such as unstructured interviews, and discusses the use of software for efficient data coding and analysis. By exploring various analytical and presentation methods, the unit prepares researchers to effectively interpret and visually communicate their findings, enhancing their ability to convey complex insights derived from qualitative investigations.</p>

									        <h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Discussion:</h3>
									
												<h3>Organizing Numerical Variables</h3>
												<p>Stacked and Unstacked Data: Discusses how to organize data for analysis, emphasizing the format (stacked vs. unstacked) to facilitate subgroup analysis.</p>
												<p>Ordered Array: Arranges numerical data from lowest to highest, aiding in understanding data range and distribution.</p>
												<p>Frequency Distribution: Summarizes data by grouping values into numerically ordered classes, helping to identify data distribution patterns.</p>
												<p>Relative Frequency and Percentage Distribution: Converts frequency counts into relative frequencies or percentages for easier comparison across different data sizes or groups.</p>
												
												<h3>Visualizing Categorical Variables</h3>
												<p>Bar and Pie Charts: Bar charts use bars to represent category frequencies or percentages, while pie charts divide a circle into slices to represent category proportions. These visual tools help compare categorical data visually.</p>
												
												<h3>Visualizing Numerical Data</h3>
												<p>Stem-and-Leaf Display, Histogram, Percentage Polygon, Cumulative Percentage Polygon (Ogive): These tools offer ways to visualize the distribution of numerical data, showing data concentration, spread, and cumulative distributions. Histograms and stem-and-leaf displays are particularly useful for showing frequency distribution, while percentage polygons and ogives provide insights into data trends and cumulative distributions.</p>
												
												<h3>Visualizing Two Numerical Variables</h3>
												<p>Scatter Plot and Time-Series Plot: Scatter plots display relationships between two numerical variables, revealing patterns, trends, or correlations. Time-series plots track changes over time, showing trends within a dataset. These visualizations are critical for identifying relationships between variables or trends over time, useful in various contexts like marketing analysis or economic trends.</p>
												
												<p>Each of these sections emphasizes different aspects of data organization and visualization, showcasing methods to analyse and present data in a comprehensible and insightful manner. From basic data arrangement to complex relationships between variables, these tools and techniques are fundamental in statistical analysis, offering a foundation for data-driven decision-making and analysis.</p>

										<h3><strong>Exercise 9.1</strong></h3>
										<p><strong>Open the Excel workbook in Exe 9.1D.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the percentage frequencies together with the bar chart just created in the above example. Add a percentage frequency bar chart showing the brand preferences in Area 2, using the same format as that employed for the Area1 results in the above example. Drag your new chart so that it lies alongside that for Area 1.</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand preferences for each of the two demographic areas?</strong></p>
										
										<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

										<p></p><a href="Exe 9.1D.xlsx" download>Click to download notebook for Workbook 9.1D </a><p>	
									
										<p>From the chart, we can interpret the following:</p>
										<ul>
										    <li>In Area 1, the preference for Brand 'Other' is dominant, accounting for 60% of the preferences, which is a significant majority. Brands A and B are less favoured, with Brand A being the least preferred at 15.7% and Brand B at 24.3%.</li>
										    <li>Conversely, in Area 2, the distribution is more even. While there is no dominant preference as clear as in Area 1, Brand 'Other' still leads at 45.6%. However, Brand B sees a substantial increase to 33.3%, suggesting it is more competitive in this area. Brand A remains the least preferred, but its share has increased to 21.1% compared to Area 1.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>The findings suggest that Brand 'Other' has a strong presence in both areas but is less dominant in Area 2. Brand B has a significantly stronger position in Area 2 than in Area 1. Brand A seems to struggle in both areas, maintaining the position of the least preferred brand.</p>

									<p></p>									
	
										<h3><strong>Exercise 9.2</strong></h3>
										<p><strong>Open the Excel workbook in Exe 9.2E.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the frequency distributions for Data Set E (see the Data Annexe) to which has been added the corresponding percentage frequency distributions. Complete a percentage frequency clustered column bar chart showing the heather species prevalences in the two different locations.</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Briefly interpret your findings.</strong></p>
										
																			
										<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
																			
										<p></p><a href="Exe 9.2E.xlsx" download>Click to download notebook for Workbook 9.2E </a><p>	
											
										<p>it can be seen that:</p>
										<ul>
										    <li>Location B has a higher percentage of absence of heather species compared to Location A.</li>
										    <li>Location A has a slightly higher percentage of sparse prevalence than Location B.</li>
										    <li>Location A has a significantly higher percentage of abundant prevalence of heather species than Location B.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>This suggests that Location A is more favourable for the growth of heather species, with a greater abundance overall, whereas Location B has a larger proportion of areas where the heather species are absent.</p>

										<h3><strong>Exercise 9.3</strong></h3>
										<p><strong></strong>Open the Excel workbook in Exe 9.3B.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the relative frequency histogram for the Diet A weight loss produced in Example 9.3 together with some of the Diet B weight loss summary statistics. Add a relative frequency histogram of the weight loss for Diet B, where possible using the same classes as those employed for the Diet A results in the above example.</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Briefly interpret your histogram. What do these results tell you about the patterns of weight loss for each of the two diets?</strong></p>
										
										<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>	
																			
										<p></p><a href="Exe 9.3B.xlsx" download>Click to download notebook for Workbook 9.3B </a><p>	
																			
										<p>Diet A shows a concentration of weight loss between 5 to 7 kilograms, with this class having the highest relative frequency. The shape of the histogram is right-skewed, indicating that a smaller number of participants experienced higher weight losses. The range of weight loss is also substantial, but there's a clear tendency for most participants to lose a moderate amount of weight.</p>
										<p>Diet B has its highest relative frequency in the 2.5 to 5.5 kilograms weight loss class, suggesting that most participants lost a moderate amount of weight, though less than the most common amount lost on Diet A. The distribution is less skewed than Diet A, but the range of weight loss is broader, showing that participants' outcomes were more varied. Some participants even experienced weight gain, as indicated by the negative values in the histogram.</p>
										<p>In summary, Diet A seems to yield a more consistent weight loss with a higher average loss, whereas Diet B has more varied outcomes with a moderate average loss. Both diets have outliers with both high weight loss and weight gain, but the patterns suggest that Diet A might be a better option for more consistent results.</p>


									<h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Reflection:</h3>

										<p>The knowledge acquired from Unit 9: Analysing Qualitative Data is immensely valuable in the context of a project module and my role as a data analyst within the hospitality sector. Qualitative data analysis offers a nuanced understanding of customer experiences, preferences, and expectations, which are often conveyed in non-quantifiable terms such as guest feedback, interviews, and service reviews. By applying methodologies from this unit, I can systematically categorize this unstructured information into actionable insights.</p>
										
										<p>The unit's focus on data visualization also complements quantitative analysis skills. Being adept at creating compelling visual representations, such as bar charts for customer satisfaction ratings or time-series plots for room occupancy rates, facilitates better communication with stakeholders. It enhances the ability to convey complex data in an accessible manner, supporting strategic decisions and operational improvements.</p>
										
										<p>In essence, the methodologies and tools explored in this unit reinforce my capability to convert qualitative guest data into qualitative improvements, fostering a culture of excellence and responsiveness in hospitality services.</p>
