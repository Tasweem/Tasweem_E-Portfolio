										<h1>Evaluation of the final project (Unit 11) vs. the initial proposal (Unit 6).</h1>
										
										<h2>Assignment 1:</h2>
										<h3>Objective:</h3>
										<p>The primary goal of this project is to use data science to obtain relevant business insights from the Airbnb dataset. Students are initially entrusted with developing a compelling business question that can add value to Airbnb's operations. Following that, they must go through an exhaustive data analysis process that includes exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, statistical inference, visualisation, and unsupervised machine learning approaches. The end result of this endeavour is a two-page analytical report intended for Airbnb's executive board that distils the important findings. Furthermore, all analytical methods must be transparently described, with Python code provided as an appendix. The main goal is to provide data-driven suggestions that are clear, succinct, and meaningful.</p>
										
										<h3>Evaluation:</h3>
										<p>The team used data science to analyse the Airbnb dataset, involving a business query, extensive analysis, and unsupervised machine learning. The goal was to create a concise report for Airbnb executives, which included data visualizations, and a deeper dive into machine learning models to cluster region according to their prices. The team's collaborative spirit, particularly in real-time feedback, ensured the project remained agile and relevant.</p>
										
										<h3>Feedback:</h3>
										<p>The evaluation praises the report's well-organized format and recognises a strong demonstration of subject knowledge. It values the application of knowledge, notably the usage of diagrams. However, there is room for improvement, including a need for more detailed data discussions, larger and better illustrations, and deeper analysis, particularly in figures 8, 9, and 10. The report might benefit from increased criticality by including literature or academic publications to back up arguments and recommendations. While the presentation and organisation were praised, comments suggested adding more references and a more comprehensive conclusion.</p>
										
										<h2>Assignment 2:</h2>
										<h3>Objective:</h3>
										<p>The main goal of this project is to use the CIFAR-10 dataset to design, create, and test a Neural Network model specialised in object recognition. As AI grows more prevalent in numerous industries, the ability to design systems capable of detecting objects becomes increasingly important. Students are charged with building a strong Neural Network using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 colour images from 10 item classifications. This includes creating separate training, validation, and testing sets. Furthermore, students must present a thorough analysis of the model's design decisions, such as the reasoning behind validation sets, the neural network's structure, activation and loss functions, and the number of epochs. The assignment concludes with a reflection on the insights and knowledge gained throughout the course of the project.</p>
										
										<h3>Evaluation:</h3>
										<p>The group presentation on "Neural Network Models for Object Recognition" provided a detailed overview of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The presentation highlighted the importance of object recognition in the digital age and the role of CNNs. The presentation discussed CNN structures, activation functions, epochs, and loss functions, and compared two CNN architectures to understand the trade-offs between computational efficiency and pattern recognition. However, the presentation could have been more concise and clearer about the challenges faced. The team's efforts to address overfitting and practical challenges like increased runtime added a real-world dimension to the theoretical discussion.</p>
