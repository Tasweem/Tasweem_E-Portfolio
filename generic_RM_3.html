										<h1> &#10021;Unit 3: Research Methods </h1>
										<h3>Outcomes from the Team Exercises and activites</h3>
									</header>

										
										<p>This module introduces research methods, emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate research designs and methods for data collection and analysis to answer research questions effectively. It covers exploratory and conclusive designs, qualitative, quantitative, and mixed research methods, and the significance of primary and secondary data collection, aiming to equip researchers with systematic tools for gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information.</p>
 

									        <h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Discussion:</h3>
									
									<p>Dawson (2015) provides a comprehensive framework for classifying research by field, approach, and nature. He identifies the field as the broad area of interest, such as artificial intelligence or software engineering, which serves to cluster researchers with aligned interests. The approach encompasses the methodologies employed in research, including but not limited to case studies and surveys, which detail the procedural execution of research. Nature, on the other hand, delineates the contribution of research to knowledge, spanning from pure theoretical development and the critique and assessment of theory for practical implementation, to applied research with direct practical outcomes. This classification underscores the significance of open-mindedness, critical analysis, and the capability to generalize findings while acknowledging their limitations. Such qualities are pivotal in ensuring research not only contributes significantly to knowledge but also advances the field through a structured methodology.</p>
									<p>Furthermore, research design is depicted as the blueprint for executing a research project, instrumental in guiding the selection of data collection and analysis methods to aptly respond to research questions. BRM (2018) differentiates between exploratory and conclusive research designs. Exploratory research is characterized by its aim to generate insights without necessarily providing definitive answers, thereby allowing for adaptability in research direction in light of emerging evidence. Conversely, conclusive research is aimed at yielding practical findings that can inform decision-making processes, necessitating a clear, structured approach to both data collection and analysis, as highlighted by Saunders et al. (2012). Within the domain of conclusive research, descriptive research is tasked with elucidating specific elements or phenomena, whereas causal research is concerned with exploring cause-and-effect relationships. Sharp et al. (2002) further reinforce the importance of selecting an appropriate research design for a project module. The choice of research design is foundational, impacting the selection of qualitative or quantitative methods, data sources, and analysis techniques. This critical decision influences the project's direction, depth, and relevance, ensuring the research not only addresses the posed questions but also makes a meaningful contribution to the field of study.</p>

									<h3>"Implementing Machine Learning Tools and Techniques in Sentiment Analysis" using Facebook data from Kaggle.</h3>
									<h4>1. Research Design</h4>
									<p><strong>Exploratory Research:</strong> It involves exploring the potential of various machine learning tools and techniques in sentiment analysis without a predefined hypothesis. For instance, assessing the effectiveness of different NLP algorithms in understanding the nuances of sentiment in Facebook posts, exploratory research allows for the flexibility to explore and identify promising methods.</p>
									<p><strong>Conclusive Research:</strong> It involves a focused evaluation of promising algorithms identified during exploratory analysis will be conducted. This involves rigorously assessing their effectiveness and efficiency in sentiment analysis, using performance metrics to quantify their capabilities and ensure the selection of the most suitable machine learning techniques.</p>
									<h4>2. Research Methods to Employ</h4>
									<p>A mixed methods approach could be highly beneficial:</p>
									<ul>
									    <li><strong>Quantitative Research:</strong> This will likely form the core of your project as you're dealing with data analysis using machine learning tools. Quantitative methods will enable me to statistically analyse the performance of different sentiment analysis models, comparing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores across various algorithms.</li>
									    <li><strong>Qualitative Research:</strong> While the primary focus might be on quantitative analysis, qualitative insights can be invaluable, especially when interpreting the context of sentiments or evaluating why certain models perform better than others. Techniques such as case studies of specific sentiment analysis challenges or interviews with experts in machine learning and NLP can provide deeper insights into the qualitative aspects of tool and technique selection.</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>3. Data Collection Methods</h4>
									<p>Secondary Research: The primary dataset comes from Kaggle, which falls under secondary research since it involves using pre-existing data. Reviewing any available metadata, documentation, and prior analyses to understand the dataset's structure, content, and any limitations is important.</p>
									<h4>4. Ethical Considerations</h4>
									<p>When using data from platforms like Facebook, even if it's through a secondary source like Kaggle, ethical considerations around privacy, consent, and data usage rights are paramount. Ensure compliance with all relevant ethical guidelines, including data anonymization and respecting user privacy.</p>

									<h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Peer Review Activity:</h3>	

									<p><strong>In this seminar, we will be focusing on LO 3: “Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic.” One way this is done is by conducting a peer review of existing literature on a particular subject.</strong></p>

									<p><strong>In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing field of your choice that utilise the two different types of research methods to achieve their goal/research aims. Now answer the following questions (please provide justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:</strong></p>
									
									<ul>
									    <li><strong>Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?</strong></li>
									    <li><strong>Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?</strong></li>
									    <li><strong>In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)</strong></li>
									    <li><strong>Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?</strong></li>
									    <li><strong>How would you enhance the work/paper?</strong></li>
									</ul>

									<p>The first paper, "Sentiment Analysis: A Comparative Study On Different Approaches," evaluates various sentiment analysis methods within the NLP domain, focusing on machine learning, rule-based, and lexicon-based approaches. It aims to categorize reviews efficiently, discussing SVM, Naive Bayes, and more, highlighting the relevance of semantic text analysis and the potential for improving analysis through n-gram evaluation and other methods. This aligns with the exploration of practical applications of sentiment analysis tools and techniques, contributing significantly to the collective knowledge in the field by comparing different analytical methodologies.</p>
									<p>The second paper, "A Survey on Sentiment Analysis Methods, Applications, and Challenges," provides a comprehensive overview of sentiment analysis, including methodological approaches like lexicon-based, machine learning, hybrid approaches, and the incorporation of word embeddings. It emphasizes the necessity of sentiment analysis in various applications, the process of data collection, feature selection, and the challenges faced in accurately interpreting sentiments. This paper enriches the understanding of sentiment analysis from a methodological and application-oriented perspective, directly contributing to the field by evaluating and comparing approaches to overcome existing challenges.</p>
									<p>Both papers are well-aligned with the project's aim of implementing machine learning tools and techniques in sentiment analysis, using appropriate methodologies for their stated purposes. They support their claims with evidence and provide a critical analysis of different sentiment analysis methods, offering a foundation for enhancing sentiment analysis work by incorporating diverse approaches and addressing methodological challenges.</p>
									

									<br></br>
									<h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Reflection & Practical Use:</h3>
										<p>Reflecting on the exploration of machine learning tools and techniques in sentiment analysis, the integration of diverse research methods and data collection strategies discussed in the seminar materials significantly enhances the approach to this complex topic. The comparative and comprehensive analysis provided by the selected papers underscores the dynamic nature of sentiment analysis within the NLP domain, revealing the necessity for both innovative machine learning applications and rigorous methodological scrutiny. This reflection not only reaffirms the importance of a mixed-methods approach for a nuanced understanding of sentiment analysis but also highlights the critical role of ethical considerations in data handling. The journey through exploratory to conclusive research designs, supplemented by the insights from peer-reviewed literature, has been instrumental in shaping a robust research framework that promises to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of sentiment analysis techniques.</p>
