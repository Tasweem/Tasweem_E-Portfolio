											<h2>Action Plan:</h2>

													
													<p>Unit 1 focuses on Scientific Investigation and Ethics, where my aim is to sharpen my critical thinking and grasp the ethical considerations pivotal in research. My strategy involves participating in workshops dedicated to research ethics and engaging in online forums discussing ethical dilemmas in case studies. This endeavor, planned for a month, is expected to broaden my ethical perspective in research and equip me with essential skills for navigating complex ethical challenges.</p>
													
													<p>For Unit 4, which covers Case Studies, Focus Groups, and Observations, I am set to enhance my qualitative research skills. By conducting a case study and leading a focus group discussion, I anticipate directly applying and refining my qualitative research capabilities. This two-month period will be an opportunity to implement these methods in practical scenarios, thereby enriching my experience and proficiency in qualitative research.</p>
													
													<p>Unit 5, dedicated to Interviews and Survey Methods, has me aiming to excel in interview and survey techniques. Planning and conducting a survey, alongside interviewing peers, will serve dual purposes: understanding the nuances of survey creation and honing my interviewing skills. This one-month venture will focus on iterative learning from both survey design and interview executions.</p>
													
													<p>In Unit 6, on Questionnaire Design, my objective is to refine my questionnaire designing skills. This involves creating a questionnaire for a research project and iterating based on feedback, a process I believe is crucial for crafting effective questionnaires. I've allocated one month to this task, anticipating significant skill enhancement through iterative design and feedback.</p>
													
													<p>Unit 7 addresses Validity and Generalisability in Research. My goal here is to delve into and apply the concepts of validity and generalizability in research design. Through analyzing existing studies and proposing methodological improvements, I aim to spend a month deepening my understanding of creating robust and applicable research designs.</p>
													
													<p>The focus of Unit 11 is
													on Professional Development â€“ Your e-Portfolio. I am committed to constructing a comprehensive e-portfolio that effectively showcases my skills and projects. By curating work samples and reflecting on my learning journey, I plan to develop an e-portfolio that articulates my competencies and achievements. I believe dedicating one month to this endeavor will result in a valuable asset for my professional development and career progression.</p>
													
													<p>Last but not least, Unit 12 revolves around Project Management and Managing Risk. My concentration here is on enhancing my skills in project management and risk assessment. Leading a small project and devising a risk management plan, coupled with a review of project management fundamentals, marks my strategy for the upcoming two months. This practical application of theoretical knowledge is anticipated to bolster my project management capabilities and risk navigation skills, laying a solid foundation for professional efficacy in any setting.</p>
