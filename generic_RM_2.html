										<h1> &#10021; Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal </h1>
										<h3>Outcomes from the Team Exercises and activites</h3>
									</header>

										
										<p>The aim of this unit is to navigate the initial stages of academic research by defining a focused topic and developing a solid research proposal. Central to this is mastering the literature review, which surveys scholarly sources to outline existing knowledge and identify gaps in the field. It discusses on how to critically evaluate theories and methods within the literature and present your findings coherently. The unit provides guidance on the selection a topic of genuine interest, ensuring that the research is engaging and contributes new insights in the chosen area. This foundational work sets the stage for a successful research endeavour</p>
 

									        <h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Discussion:</h3>

										<p>From the lecture cast, I learned that a research question is the cornerstone of a scholarly inquiry, guiding the direction and coherence of the study. It must be clear, focused, and complex enough to avoid a straightforward yes or no answer, demanding a nuanced approach that necessitates research and critical analysis. The process of crafting a research question is iterative; it evolves as data is gathered, sharpening the research's focus and depth.</p>
	
										<p>A well-formulated research question sets the stage for the entire research project, delineating the scope and informing the methodology. It helps to determine what data to collect and how to interpret it. The question's clarity ensures that the research remains on track, while its complexity ensures that the analysis contributes to the field's knowledge base. The feasibility of the question is equally important, considering practical limitations such as access to subjects, costs, and time.</p>
										
										<p><cite>Dawson (2015)</cite> emphasizes the criticality of selecting the right project and supervisor in the research process. It advises that choosing a suitable project is vital and provides techniques to aid this decision. The chapter outlines the importance of a project proposal, which should implicitly cover the project's background, identify a research gap, and explain how the project aims to fill this gap, including risk assessment and contingency planning <cite>(Day-Miller et al., 2009)</cite>. It highlights two golden rules for proposal preparation: adherence to guidelines and meticulous proofreading. When choosing a supervisor, one should consider their track record with student completions, views on managing student research, expertise in their field, research methodology competence, and their accessibility and approachability. For taught degree students, a supervisor’s managerial and pastoral roles are more crucial than their technical expertise, although they should have enough understanding to provide necessary assistance. Relevant literature includes <cite>Hughes and Cotterell (2006)</cite> on software project management, which can offer further insights into the complexities of research in computing and information systems.</p>
										
										<p>The lecture cast also underscored the importance of literature reviews in research. A literature review not only informs the research question but also situates the study within the existing body of knowledge. It involves a critical evaluation of relevant literature, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of previous work, which in turn shapes the research approach. The lecture emphasized the necessity of accurate citation and documentation, which underpins the academic integrity of the research process.</p>
										
										<p><cite>Dawson (2015)</cite> delves into literature searching and reviews, crucial for situating research within its broader academic context and justifying its relevance. It discusses efficient search strategies, including the use of online public access catalogues (OPACs), databases like IEEE Computer Society, and other resources such as the DBLP bibliography and HCI Bibliography, to find pertinent scholarly materials. The chapter emphasizes the importance of inter-library loans for accessing materials not readily available, highlighting the system's potential drawbacks, such as cost and time <cite>(Frederiksen et al., 2015)</cite>. It provides practical tips for conducting literature searches, suggesting the use of review articles, correct referencing from the start, and the organization of materials for effective information management <cite>(Paré et al., 2017)</cite>. Critical evaluation of literature is discussed, urging readers to consider the author's credibility, the article's contribution to the field, and its relationship with other works. The chapter culminates in guidance on writing literature reviews, outlining their purpose to refine research questions, highlight research possibilities, and identify useful methods. It advises against merely listing read materials, advocating for a structured presentation that critically engages with and situates the research within existing literature.</p>

									      
									
									<h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Reflection & Practical Use:</h3>
										<p>Reflecting on the insights from Unit 2, I recognize the foundational importance of a well-defined research question and the critical role of a comprehensive literature review in framing a research proposal. Understanding that a research question should be clear, focused, and sufficiently complex has reshaped my approach to formulating the central inquiry of my project module. It has taught me the value of an iterative process, where refining my question in light of new data can significantly sharpen the focus and depth of my research. Additionally, the emphasis on selecting a suitable project and supervisor resonates with me; recognizing that a supportive and knowledgeable supervisor can significantly enhance the research journey and outcome.</p>
								         	<p>The discussions on literature reviews have highlighted their instrumental role in not only informing my research question but also in embedding my study within the broader scholarly context. By critically evaluating existing literature, I can identify gaps in knowledge and position my research to contribute new insights. This process will ensure that my project module is both grounded in existing scholarship and poised for a meaningful contribution to the field. The emphasis on meticulous documentation and citation will also guide me in maintaining the academic integrity of my work. Overall, the principles learned from this unit will be instrumental in developing a well-structured, coherent, and impactful research proposal for my project module.</p>
