									<p>The first discussion was the evaluation of the rationale behind the Internet of Things (IOT) in the context of the article by Huxley et al. (2020), highlighting the opportunities, limitations, risks, and challenges associated with such a large-scale process of data collection</p>
									   The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm based on the Internet that comprises of many interconnected technologies in order to exchange information.(Diaz et al., 2016).However, there are several limitations of associated devices in the IoT in terms of storage, network, and computing, as well as the requirements of complex analysis, scalability, and data access. Thus, as mentioned by peers, this necessitates continuous technological advancements and investments, as emphasized by Gartner in 2015.
									<p>One of the main challenges is dealing with security issues when performing data cleaning on a large volume of data. Since data cleaning processes must be performed using automated data cleaning tools, inconsistent software may be used that will clean the data based on faulty models and thus decrease the quality of the data and create the possibility of breaches</p>
									<p>Another challenge is that it is even more difficult to protect the data that is stored in the cloud and requires more security tools to protect it from DDoS attacks, ransomware, theft, and other malicious activities. Thus, companies need to invest in big data security and privacy tools to protect their data and understand the newest threats. Failure to do so could result in severe financial losses and other organizational problems, as severe fines and restrictions could be imposed under the GDPR.</p>
									<p>In conclusion, IoT data has many prospects for increased decision-making and efficiency, but there are substantial obstacles to efficiently store and clean the data for usage. For the IoT to reach its full potential, reliable, scalable, and secure data cleaning technologies must be created.</p>
