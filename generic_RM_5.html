										<h1> &#10021;Unit 5: Interviews and Survey Methods </h1>
										<h3>Outcomes from the Team Exercises and activites</h3>
									</header>

										
										<p>In this module, the objective was to provide essential knowledge and skills for the effective utilization of interviews and surveys within research paradigms. The exploration encompassed the critical examination of population and sample concepts, alongside an in-depth analysis of pre- and post-testing methods. The intent was to ascertain the applicability and integration of these methodologies to augment investigative endeavours, thereby ensuring a robust comprehension of research methodologies. This endeavour facilitated a methodical approach to data collection and analysis, culminating in the derivation of well-informed, evidence-based conclusions. It aimed to enhance the efficacy and depth of their investigative pursuits, contributing to the broader discourse within the academic community.</p>
 

									        <h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Discussion:</h3>
									
										<h3>Interviews</h3>
										<p>Interviews are a fundamental qualitative research tool aimed at capturing in-depth insights from respondents. This method, characterized by its conversational nature, allows researchers to explore the experiences, opinions, and motivations of individuals on a one-to-one basis. The distinction between structured and unstructured interviews, as described by Dawson (2015), highlights the flexibility of this method in accommodating different research needs. Structured interviews are guided by a set of predetermined questions, ensuring consistency across sessions, while unstructured interviews allow for more open-ended discussions, potentially uncovering richer data (Berndtsson et al., 2008). The success of interviews depends on careful preparation, including the selection of interviewees, formulation of questions, and considerations for confidentiality and ethical issues. Trust between the interviewer and interviewee is paramount, as it significantly influences the depth and quality of information shared.</p>
										
										<h3>Survey Design</h3>
										<p>Surveys, particularly those administered online, offer a quantitative approach to data collection, enabling researchers to gather information from a wide audience efficiently. The evolution of technology has simplified the distribution and accessibility of surveys across various devices, allowing for real-time data collection. To enhance response rates, organizations often employ strategies such as short surveys and incentives for participants. A balanced mix of open-ended and closed questions is crucial for eliciting comprehensive responses while maintaining the structure necessary for quantitative analysis. This mix allows researchers to explore specific topics in depth while also gathering measurable data that can be easily analyzed statistically.</p>
										
										<h3>Pre- and Post- Testing and Analysis</h3>
										<p>Pre- and post-testing analysis provides a framework for evaluating changes over time, akin to before-and-after comparisons. This method is particularly useful in assessing the impact of new processes, systems, or interventions on predefined outcomes. By measuring variables before and after the implementation of a change, researchers can identify significant differences and infer the effectiveness of the intervention. Pre-post testing is applicable in various contexts, from web development to process improvement, and requires a clear definition of measurable outcomes. Statistical tests are employed to determine the significance of changes observed, with the nature of the data (quantitative or qualitative) guiding the choice of analytical methods.</p>
										
										<h3>Integration of Methods</h3>
										<p>The integration of interviews, surveys, and pre- and post-testing analysis offers a robust approach to research, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of research questions. Interviews can inform survey design by identifying key themes and areas of interest, while surveys can provide a broader context for in-depth qualitative investigations. Pre- and post-testing can further enhance these methods by offering a structured framework for assessing the impact of interventions over time.</p>
										
										<p>This synthesis underscores the importance of meticulous planning, ethical considerations, and the strategic use of various research methods to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the research subject. Each method offers unique strengths and, when combined, can provide a holistic view of the research topic, contributing to the depth and breadth of research findings.</p>

									<h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Reflective Activity 2 - Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h3>
									
									<p><strong>In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.</strong></p>
									
									<p><strong>Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.</strong></p>
									
									<br></br>
									<p></p>
									<p></p>
									
								<p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal, revealed in 2018, exemplified the perils of misusing survey data for political manipulation, sparking global concern over digital privacy. The firm illicitly harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users through a deceptive survey app, "This is your digital life," developed by Aleksandr Kogan, without the users' or Facebook's consent. This breach of trust highlighted the vulnerabilities in social media data protection and the potential for such data to be exploited for political gain.</p>

								<p><strong>Legal Impact:</strong> The scandal led to significant legal repercussions for Facebook, including plummeting stock prices and Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before the US Congress. It underscored the necessity for stringent data protection regulations, contributing to the enforcement and awareness of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, which mandates rigorous consent protocols and offers individuals greater control over their personal data.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Social Impact:</strong> Public outcry following the revelations forced a reevaluation of privacy norms in the digital age, eroding trust in social media platforms and raising awareness about the importance of data security. Users became more cautious of their online footprint and sceptical of data collection practices.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Ethical Impact:</strong> The unethical acquisition and use of personal data for electoral purposes raised profound ethical questions regarding the responsibilities of tech companies and data analysts. It spotlighted the need for ethical standards in data collection and usage, emphasizing transparency, consent, and respect for privacy.</p>
								
								<p>In summary, the Cambridge Analytica scandal marked a turning point in the discourse on digital privacy, instigating legal, social, and ethical changes that continue to influence how personal data is collected, used, and protected worldwide.</p>
								
								<p>Another example is Emotional Contagion Study by Facebook (2014)</p>
								
								<p><strong>Background:</strong> Facebook conducted a psychological experiment on nearly 700,000 unsuspecting users to study emotional contagion through social networks. The study manipulated the emotional content of users' news feeds to assess the effect on their emotions, without explicit consent.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Ethical Impact:</strong> This experiment raised serious ethical concerns about consent and manipulation, as participants were not informed their data would be used for research purposes, violating ethical standards in psychological research.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Social Impact:</strong> The revelation of the study led to public outrage and a debate on privacy and ethical standards in social media experiments, eroding trust in Facebook and other social media platforms.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Legal Impact:</strong> Although not resulting in direct legal action, the incident highlighted the need for clearer regulations and consent mechanisms in user experiments and data usage, influencing discussions around data protection laws.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Professional Impact:</strong> The backlash from the experiment prompted discussions within the tech and research communities about the responsibilities of platforms in conducting research with user data, leading to more stringent internal review processes for research involving human participants.</p>
