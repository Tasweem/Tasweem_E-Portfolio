									   <h2> &#10021; Data cleaning and Transformation </h2>
   									   <p>Data cleaning, also called data cleansing or scrubbing, aims at detecting and removing errors and inconsistencies from data to improve the quality of data. <span class="reference">(Rahm et al, 2000)</span>. Data quality issues can occur in a variety of application situations and need to be handled properly to ensure the accuracy of the information. Missing numbers, duplicates, misspelt words, inconsistent data, and incorrect data formats are a few examples of data anomalies. <span class="reference">(Galhardas, 2006)</span>.</p>

    									  <h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Examples of causes of errors and inconsistencies:</h3>
   									   <ul>
 									          <li>Data from various sources may have been created at different times, by different people using various conventions to translate real-world entities into data. For instance, the same customer may be addressed by slightly different but accurate names at various tables, such as "Paul Brown," "Brown Paul," or "P. Brown." In the case of a single source, this issue is known as the object or instance identification problem, duplicate elimination, or record linkage problem.</li>
									          <li>Missing values is also made possible by the fact that amalgamated data is created and utilised by several entities. For example, knowing a client's age is crucial for the marketing department but completely insignificant for the accounting one.</li>
									          <li>A variety of formats can be used to write data. Data fields may embed data of various types because no standard notation is typically required (these are known as "free-form fields"). An illustration is a street field with the country name and zip code entered wrongly. Additionally, synonyms and abbreviations may be used to refer to an object that is listed under its full name in another record.</li>
									          <li>Even when the same naming standards are used in several databases, data might still contain errors, mainly because of typos, such as "Pul Brown".</li>
 									          <li>There may be discrepancies in data, such as two records for the same person having two different birth dates.</li>
   									   </ul>

    									  <h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Application of Data Cleaning:</h3>
    									      <ol>
      									        <li>In the book "Data Wrangling with Python by Kazil, J & Jarmul, K", the authors investigated methods for standardising data formats to address inconsistent formatting. They look at Python packages like pandas, which offer functions for data transformations, formatting, and parsing. Analysts can guarantee consistency and comparability across the dataset by using these strategies.</li>
       									        <li>Also, the authors discuss on the handling of missing values which is an important component of data cleaning and the strategies for handling missing data in datasets using several techniques like data imputation, dropping missing values, and leveraging libraries like pandas and NumPy to handle missing data effectively.</li>
            									<li>Data transformation is a specific application of data cleaning. Data transformations are applied across several different jobs and at various ETL life cycle phases. For instance, transformations focus on standardising data formats, imposing standard patterns, or trimming long strings prior to the execution of a data integration project. At the end of the ETL process, transformations are also used, for instance, to combine groups of duplicate records, to identify a singular representation for a group of records (known as the "golden record"), or to get the data ready for consumption by analytics software. <span class="reference">(Chu et al, 2019)</span>.</li>
        								      </ol>

        									<p>By thoroughly addressing data quality issues, analysts can ensure that their datasets are cleaned, validated, and ready for further analysis. This module provided a complete coverage of data cleaning techniques which equips data analysts with the knowledge and skills to handle real-world data challenges effectively.</p>
