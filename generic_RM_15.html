										<h1>Evaluation of the Literature Review and Research Proposal</h1>
									</header>

												<h2>A. Literature Review</h2>
												    <h3>Comments for Literature Review:</h3>
												    <p>Thank you for your submission of your literature review, which ideally builds on the draft and formative feedback provided (if you have submitted one for comment) and on the materials covered in the literature review unit.</p>
												    <p>As you know, the assignment is marked according to a few components, such as your overall understanding of the topic and a clear outline of your own research, the degree of coverage of the current debate, and the quality and structure of the LR itself.</p>
												    <p>I think you did a fine job with your LR. Below you can find some specific comments.</p>
												    <h4>1. Knowledge and Understanding</h4>
												    <p>The word demonstrates a well-developed ability to provide a critical discussion.</p>
												    <p>Your ideas are structured and coherent, and the historical background was effective, although maybe too long for an overall 2,000 word LR.</p>
												    <p>While you offered a good identification of the aims, the research questions could have been made more explicit to inform the narrative in a more convincing way.</p>
												    <h4>2. Critical discussion & Contribution</h4>
												    <p>The review addressed the limitations and presented a coherent timeline, well done. Offering some additional insights into the challenges of the adoption of models in sentiment analysis in connection to the sector practices would have been even more convincing.</p>
												    <h4>3. Structure and Presentation</h4>
												    <p>The literature consulted is substantial and demonstrates evidence of wider reading in the discipline. You structured your review well, with a good introduction, an attempt to analyse the literature, an articulated section on challenges and future trends (good) and conclusions, which could have been made more incisive.</p>
												    <p>Harvard System has been correctly used.</p>
												    <p>Your Turnitin score of 51% and an analysis of the turnitin report suggest an original assignment (the high score was due to the literature).</p>
												    <p>Good job! You certainly understood how to carry out a literature review.</p>
												    <h3>Reflection on Comments:</h3>
												    <p>Reflecting on the feedback received for my literature review, I'm heartened by the recognition of my critical engagement and coherent structure, alongside constructive critiques that pinpoint areas for refinement. The advice to balance content more judiciously, particularly by streamlining the historical background to allocate more space for explicit research questions, is a key takeaway that I intend to apply immediately. This guidance is not just pertinent for the review but is invaluable as I advance into my project module.</p>
												    <p>The suggestion to deepen the discussion around sector-specific challenges in sentiment analysis has opened my eyes to the importance of linking theoretical insights to practical applications. This approach will not only enrich my literature review but also enhance the relevance and impact of my upcoming project work. Emphasizing clearer research questions and a more incisive conclusion will help sharpen my project's focus, enabling me to communicate my findings more effectively and persuasively.</p>
												    <p>Moreover, the feedback underscores the significance of a well-structured presentation and rigorous research, reaffirmed by a satisfactory Turnitin score that reflects the originality of my work. This bolsters my confidence in adhering to high academic standards, which is critical as I embark on the project module. These lessons in balancing detailed analysis with concise presentation, articulating clear research objectives, and drawing potent conclusions will be instrumental in guiding my project's development, ensuring it is both substantive and impactful. As I reflect on this feedback, I am motivated to integrate these insights into my project module, viewing them as essential stepping stones towards achieving academic excellence and contributing meaningfully to my field.</p>
												    
												    <h2>B. Research Proposal</h2>
												    <h3>Comments for Research Proposal</h3>
												    <p>Thank you for the submission of your research proposal.</p>
												    <p>The assignment required a PPT presentation in a video format of your choice, covering the main points of a proposal, and namely, RQs, methodology, and some pointers to the theoretical framework underpinning your research. You had the opportunity to submit a draft for formative feedback, and I do hope you made good use of the possibility.</p>
												    <p>This was a good presentation. Below you will find a breakdown of the grade:</p>
												    <h4>1. Knowledge and Understanding</h4>
												    <p>You demonstrated a quite good understanding of the chosen topic.</p>
												    <p>All the key sections of the presentation are present but not all are equally developed. The background could have been expanded. There is uneven evidence of critical analysis in the key sections of the presentation and could have been more thorough.</p>
												    <h4>2. Presentation and Communication Skills</h4>
												    <p>The research questions were set clearly and along with the aims and objectives.</p>
												    <h4>3. Criticality</h4>
												    <p>The methodology is well designed and promising.</p>
												    <p>To engage the audience, the presentation needs some improvement -- adding, for instance, more explanatory points to your slides on one and reducing the overall length on the other (you are two minutes over the max).</p>
												    <p>The references are overall fine.</p>
												    <p>I think you're now ready for the actual final project and could use this as a starting point.</p>
												    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
												    <p>The feedback on my research proposal presentation serves as both an affirmation of the work I've put into understanding my chosen topic and a guidepost for areas requiring further development. Recognizing that my presentation demonstrated a good grasp of the subject matter is encouraging, yet the critique regarding the uneven development of key sections, particularly the need for an expanded background and more thorough critical analysis, highlights a crucial area for improvement.</p>
												    <p>This feedback is instrumental as I transition into the project module of my research. It underscores the importance of a balanced presentation where each section is developed with equal care and attention to detail. To address this, I will aim to deepen my exploration of the background information, ensuring it provides a solid foundation for the research questions, methodology, and theoretical framework I propose. Enhancing the critical analysis throughout the presentation will also be a priority, as it is essential for demonstrating the depth of my engagement with the topic and the scholarly discourse surrounding it.</p>
												    <p>Applying these insights to my research proposal for the project module, I am motivated to enhance the structure and depth of my presentation. By focusing on creating a more balanced and critically engaged proposal, I can set a solid foundation for my final project, ensuring it is both rigorous and compelling. This feedback not only aids in refining my current work but also contributes to my ongoing development as a researcher, preparing me to undertake more complex and detailed scholarly projects in the future.</p>
