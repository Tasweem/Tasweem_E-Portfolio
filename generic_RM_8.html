										<h1> &#10021;Unit 8: Inferential Statistics </h1>
										<h3>Outcomes from the Team Exercises and activites</h3>
									</header>

									
									<p>The aim of Unit 8: Inferential Statistics is to provide the skills to analyse quantitative data through various statistical methods, enabling them to describe datasets, create and conduct hypothesis tests, and make informed inferences about a population from a sample. This module introduces the principles of statistical inference, emphasizing the importance of understanding data variability, the levels of measurement of variables, and the quantification of uncertainty using probability. Through exploring graphical summaries, measures of location and dispersion, and hypothesis testing, learners will develop the capability to extract meaningful business intelligence from data, thereby enhancing their ability to make evidence-based decisions.</p>
										

									        <h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Discussion:</h3>
									
											<p>The lecture cast discusses on data analysis and statistical inference which are foundational components in the realm of research, providing a systematic approach to understanding and interpreting the observed values of variables within datasets. These datasets are organized into tables, where columns represent variables and rows signify individual observations, facilitating a structured examination of the data.</p>
											
											<p>Understanding the level of measurement for each variable is paramount in selecting the appropriate analysis methodology. Variables can be classified into four levels: ratio, interval, ordinal, and nominal, each with distinct characteristics that influence the choice of statistical techniques. Ratio and interval levels are quantitative, allowing for measurements of quantity and calculations that include meaningful zero points (ratio) or lack thereof (interval). In contrast, ordinal and nominal levels are qualitative, capturing categorizations with inherent order (ordinal) or without (nominal), thus guiding the analyst in applying correct statistical methods for analysis.</p>
											
											<p>The distinction between discrete and continuous variables, relevant only to quantitative data, further specifies the analytical approach. Discrete variables represent countable quantities, while continuous variables encompass an infinite range of values within a given interval, each requiring different statistical treatments for accurate interpretation.</p>
											
											<p>Graphical summaries, such as bar charts and histograms, along with measures of location (e.g., mean, median) and dispersion (e.g., standard deviation, interquartile range), are essential tools in summarizing data. These tools not only facilitate a preliminary understanding of the data but also guide the subsequent inferential analysis.</p>
											
											<p>Inferential statistics, encompassing hypothesis testing and estimation, enables researchers to draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. Through hypothesis testing, researchers assess the validity of assumptions about population parameters, incorporating the uncertainty inherent in sample data through probability. This process involves stating hypotheses, setting criteria for decisions, computing test statistics, and making informed decisions based on the observed evidence.</p>
											
											<p>In summary, the methodologies encompassed in data sets, observations, variables, and levels of measurement, along with the strategic application of inferential statistics, form the backbone of effective data analysis. These principles ensure that researchers and analysts can extract meaningful insights from data, thereby making informed decisions and contributing to the advancement of knowledge across various fields.</p>

												<h3><strong>Exercise 8.4</strong></h3>
												<p><strong>Consider the filtration data of Data Set G. Open the Excel workbook Exe8.4G.xlsx which contains these data from the Exercises folder.</strong>></p>
												<p><strong>Assuming the data to be suitably distributed, complete a two-tailed test of whether the population mean impurity differs between the two filtration agents, and interpret your findings.</strong></p>
												
												<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

									                        <p>Assuming the data are suitably distributed, conduct a two-tailed test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the population mean impurity levels between the two filtration agents, and interpret your findings.</p>
												
												<p><em>D = Agent1 – Agent2</em></p>
												<p>We will assume for now that the data are indeed normally distributed so that the resulting t-test is valid.</p>
												<p>The relevant output is as follows:</p>
												
												<ul>
												    <li>Mean: Agent1 = 8.25, Agent2 = 8.683333333</li>
												    <li>Variance: Agent1 = 1.059090909, Agent2 = 1.077878788</li>
												    <li>Observations: 12 for both agents</li>
												    <li>Pearson Correlation: 0.901055812</li>
												    <li>Hypothesized Mean Difference: 0</li>
												    <li>Degrees of Freedom (df): 11</li>
												    <li>t Stat: -3.263938591</li>
												    <li>P(T&lt;=t) one-tail: 0.003772997</li>
												    <li>t Critical one-tail: 1.795884819</li>
												    <li>P(T&lt;=t) two-tail: 0.007545995</li>
												    <li>t Critical two-tail: 2.20098516</li>
												</ul>
												
												<p>The obtained related samples t = -3.264 with 11 degrees of freedom. The associated two-tailed p-value is p = 0.0075, so the observed t is significant at the 5% level (two-tailed). The analysis of impurity levels for two filtration agents reveals a discernible difference in their effectiveness. Specifically, the average impurity level processed by Agent 1 is 8.25, compared to Agent 2's 8.6833. This disparity, quantified as a mean difference of -0.4333, alongside a t-statistic of -3.264 and a p-value of 0.0075, provides robust evidence that the population mean impurity significantly varies between the two agents. Given these statistical results, which are significant at the 5% level in a two-tailed test, it is inferred that Agent 1 yields a lower mean impurity level than Agent 2. This suggests a preference for Agent 1's utilization over Agent 2 for achieving superior filtration efficacy.</p>

												<h3><strong>Exercise 8.5</strong></h3>
												<p><strong>Recall that in Exercise 8.4, a two-tailed test was undertaken of whether the population mean impurity differs between the two filtration agents in Data Set G.</strong></p>
												<p><strong>Suppose instead a one-tailed test had been conducted to determine whether Filter Agent 1 was the more effective. What would your conclusions have been?</strong>></p>
												
												<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
										 	        <p></p><a href="Exe 8.4G.xlsx" download>Click to download notebook for Workbook 8.4G </a><p>									
											   
									                       <p>Suppose Filter Agent 1 represents a novel filtration method aiming for higher efficacy, while Filter Agent 2 corresponds to the conventional method currently in use. The objective becomes not just to identify if there is a difference in the effectiveness of the filtration agents but specifically to determine if Filter Agent 1 is superior to Filter Agent 2. Thus, the investigators seek evidence that μ1 > μ2, so wish to test:</p>
												
												<p><em>H0: μ1 ≤ μ2</em> against <em>H1: μ1 > μ2</em></p>
												
												<p>The relevant t-test is conducted exactly as before. However, this time, the results are interpreted a little differently. The relevant output is as follows:</p>
												
												<ul>
												    <li>Mean: Agent1 = 8.25, Agent2 = 8.683333333</li>
												    <li>Variance: Agent1 = 1.059090909, Agent2 = 1.077878788</li>
												    <li>Observations: 12 for both agents</li>
												    <li>Pearson Correlation: 0.901055812</li>
												    <li>Hypothesized Mean Difference: 0</li>
												    <li>df: 11</li>
												    <li>t Stat: -3.263938591</li>
												    <li>P(T&lt;=t) one-tail: 0.003772997</li>
												    <li>t Critical one-tail: 1.795884819</li>
												    <li>P(T&lt;=t) two-tail: 0.007545995</li>
												    <li>t Critical two-tail: 2.20098516</li>
												</ul>
												
												<p>The obtained related samples t = -3.264 with 11 degrees of freedom. The associated two-tailed p-value is p = 0.0038, so the observed t is significant at the 5% level (one-tailed). In the context of a one-tailed test aimed at determining if Filter Agent 1 is more effective than Agent 2, using the t-statistic of -3.264 and adapting the two-tailed p-value of 0.0075 to a one-tailed context results in a p-value of approximately 0.00375. This significant result, well below the alpha threshold of 0.05, strongly suggests that Filter Agent 1 indeed performs better in reducing impurity levels compared to Filter Agent 2. Therefore, the analysis convincingly supports the preference for Filter Agent 1 over Agent 2 for improved filtration effectiveness.</p>

												<h3><strong>Exercise 8.6</strong></h3>
												<p><strong>Consider the bank cardholder data of Data Set C. Open the Excel workbook Exe8.6C.xlsx which contains this data from the Exercises folder<strong>.</strong></p>
												<p><strong>Assuming the data to be suitably distributed, complete an appropriate test of whether the population mean income for males exceeds that of females and interpret your findings. What assumptions underpin the validity of your analysis, and how could you validate them?</strong></p>
												
												<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

										        	<p></p><a href="Exe 8.6CG.xlsx" download>Click to download notebook for Workbook 8.6C </a><p>
									
												<p>Since the population of mean and the population of females are separate samples of individuals, the independent samples t-test is used.</p>
												<p>Assumptions for the t-test include:
												<ul>
												    <li>The samples are independent.</li>
												    <li>Each sample is from a normally distributed population.</li>
												    <li>The populations have equal variances (as suggested by the F-test).</li>
												</ul>
												</p>
												<p>The relevant output is as follows:</p>
												<p><strong>F-Test Two-Sample for Variances</strong></p>
												<ul>
												    <li>Mean: Variable 1 = 52.91333333, Variable 2 = 44.23333333</li>
												    <li>Variance: Variable 1 = 233.1289718, Variable 2 = 190.1758192</li>
												    <li>Observations: 60 for both Variable 1 and Variable 2</li>
												    <li>df: 59 for both Variable 1 and Variable 2</li>
												    <li>F: 1.225860221</li>
												    <li>P(F&lt;=f) one-tail: 0.21824624</li>
												    <li>F Critical one-tail: 1.539956607</li>
												</ul>
												<p>Since the p-value is greater than the common alpha level of 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis that the variances are equal. This justifies the use of a two-sample t-test assuming equal variances.</p>
												<p>Since we wish to test if the population mean income for males exceeds that of females, a two-tailed t-test is appropriate here. The relevant output is as follows:</p>
												<ul>
												    <li>Mean: Variable 1 = 52.91333333, Variable 2 = 44.23333333</li>
												    <li>Variance: Variable 1 = 233.1289718, Variable 2 = 190.1758192</li>
												    <li>Observations: 60 for both Variable 1 and Variable 2</li>
												    <li>Pooled Variance: 211.6523955</li>
												    <li>Hypothesized Mean Difference: 0</li>
												    <li>df: 118</li>
												    <li>t Stat: 3.267900001</li>
												    <li>P(T&lt;=t) one-tail: 0.000709735</li>
												    <li>t Critical one-tail: 1.657869522</li>
												    <li>P(T&lt;=t) two-tail: 0.00141947</li>
												    <li>t Critical two-tail: 1.980272249</li>
												</ul>
												<p>The obtained two-sample t-test results in a t-statistic of 3.268 with 118 degrees of freedom.</p>
												<p>The associated two-tailed p-value is p = 0.00142, which signifies that the observed t is significant at the 1% level for a two-tailed test.</p>
												<p>The sample means for Variable 1 and Variable 2 are 52.91 and 44.23, respectively. The data therefore provide strong evidence that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean incomes, with Variable 1 having a higher mean than Variable 2 by an estimated difference of 8.68.</p>
												<p>The results robustly indicate that there is a significant difference in the average incomes between the two groups represented by Variable 1 and Variable 2, suggesting that the group represented by Variable 1 has a higher mean income.</p>

												<h3><strong>Exercise 8.1</strong></h3>
												<p><strong>Open the Excel workbook in Exe 8.1B.xlsx from the Exercises folder. Obtain the sample size, sample mean weight loss, and the sample standard deviation of the weight loss for Diet B. Place these results in the block of cells F23 to F25, using the same format as that employed for the Diet A results in the above example.</strong></p>
												<p><strong>Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?</strong></p>
												
												<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
										
									                        <p></p><a href="Exe 8.1B.xlsx" download>Click to download notebook for Workbook 8.1B </a><p>

									
												<p>The sample size for Diet B is n = 50 (50 individuals undertook Diet B)</p>
												<p>The sample mean weight loss for Diet B is = 3.710. The average weight loss for those individuals who undertook Diet B is 3.710 kg. So, the diet appears to have been less effective than A.</p>
												<p>The sample standard deviation of the weight loss for Diet B is s = 2.769 kg.</p>
												<p>However, this comparison suggests that Diet A is more effective on average in reducing weight than Diet B, as indicated by the higher mean weight loss. Additionally, the slightly lower standard deviation for Diet A suggests that weight loss among the participants on Diet A was somewhat more consistent than for those on Diet B.</p>
												<p>However, to make a definitive statement about the relative effectiveness of the two diets, a statistical test such as an independent samples t-test would typically be conducted to determine whether the observed difference in mean weight loss is statistically significant, meaning it is unlikely to have occurred by chance.</p>
												<p>Given the mean and standard deviation for both diets and the sample size being equal, the difference in means (5.341 - 3.710 = 1.631 units) can be considered substantial, and if tested statistically, it could potentially indicate a significant difference in the effectiveness of these two diets.</p>

									<p></p>		

									
												<h3><strong>Exercise 8.2</strong></h3>
												<p><strong></strong>Open the Excel workbook in Exe 8.2B.xlsx from the Exercises folder. Obtain the sample median, first and third quartiles and the sample interquartile range of the weight loss for Diet B. Place these results in the block of cells F26 to F29, using the same format as that employed for the Diet A results in the above example.</strong></p>
												<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

									     		        <p></p><a href="Exe 8.2B.xlsx" download>Click to download notebook for Workbook 8.2B </a><p>	
												       
												<p>The sample median weight loss for Diet B is M = 3.745kg, so the diet appears to have been less effective than A.</p>
												<p>The sample interquartile range of the weight loss for Diet B is IQR = 3.451kg.</p>
												<p>The median weight loss for Diet B being 3.745 units suggests that half of the participants lost more than this amount and the other half lost less. The IQR, which is 3.4505 units, indicates the spread of the middle 50% of the data around the median, with a relatively moderate spread which could suggest variability in individual responses to Diet B.</p>
												<p>When compared to Diet A, which had a mean weight loss of 5.341 units, Diet B's median weight loss is lower. Although median and mean measure different aspects of central tendency and can be affected differently by outliers and skewed distributions, this comparison suggests that Diet A might be more effective on average than Diet B.</p>
												<p>Additionally, statistical tests could be used to determine if the differences in means or medians are statistically significant.</p>

												<h3><strong>Exercise 8.3</strong></h3>
												<p><strong>Open the Excel workbook in Exe 8.3D.xlsx from the Exercises folder. Obtain the frequencies and percentage frequencies of the variable Brand, but this time for the Area 2 respondents, using the same format as that employed for the Area1 results in the above example.</strong></p>

												<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

									     		        <p></p><a href="Exe 8.3D.xlsx" download>Click to download notebook for Workbook 8.3D </a><p>	

									
												<p><strong>Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand preferences for each of the two demographic areas?</strong></p>
												<p>Thus, of the 90 respondents in Area 2, 21.1% preferred Brand A, 33.3% preferred Brand B, and the remaining 45.6% also preferred some other brand of breakfast cereal.</p>
												<p>It shows that Brand B has a higher presence in Area 2 (33.3%) compared to Area 1 (24.3%). Similarly, Brand A is more present in Area 2 (21.1%) than in Area 1 (15.7%). The 'Other' category has a larger percentage in Area 1 (60.0%) compared to Area 2 (45.6%). This suggests that Area 2 has a more even distribution among the brands, while 'Other' brands dominate in Area 1.</p>

									<h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Reflection:</h3>


												<p>In the hospitality industry, where operational excellence and guest satisfaction are paramount, the application of inferential statistics is critical. The "Unit 8: Inferential Statistics" module has endowed me with the necessary skills to navigate through complex data, understand variability, and apply statistical inference. This knowledge is particularly pertinent when analyzing diverse data types, from ordinal guest satisfaction ratings to nominal cuisine preferences, and quantitative financial metrics.</p>
												
												<p>The ability to conduct hypothesis testing, a key skill acquired from the module, is particularly relevant in the hospitality sector's dynamic environment. It enables the evaluation of new service protocols or guest experience initiatives with empirical rigor. For instance, I can now statistically ascertain the impact of a new check-in process or a menu change on guest satisfaction.</p>
												
												<p>Moreover, the facility to represent data graphically and summarize it through descriptive statistics has been instrumental in my role as a data analyst. This skill not only aids in the preliminary understanding of data patterns but also in conveying findings to stakeholders who may not possess a deep understanding of statistical analysis.</p>
												
												<p>Applying these principles to my project module has significantly enhanced my analytical acumen. As a data analyst in the hospitality sector, I am now better equipped to extract meaningful insights from data, guiding evidence-based decisions that can lead to improved guest experiences, operational efficiencies, and a stronger competitive edge for my organization. The strategic application of the statistical inference principles learned ensures that the analyses I conduct are both robust and impactful, paving the way for data-driven advancement in the hospitality industry.</p>
