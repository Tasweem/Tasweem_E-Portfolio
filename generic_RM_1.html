										<h1> &#10021; Unit 1 - Scientific Investigation and Ethics </h1>
										<h3>Outcomes from the Team Exercises and activites</h3>
									</header>

										
										<p>In this unit, we delved into the scientific method's key problem-solving techniques, focusing on Deductive and Inductive reasoning—essential forms of inference in research. Deductive reasoning guides the researcher from a general idea to specific observations, while inductive reasoning reverses this path, leading from specific observations to broader generalizations. Deduction, as outlined by Miessler in 2020, relies on the accuracy of assumptions to reach a flawless conclusion, which can be challenging outside controlled scientific environments due to the potential lack of universally accepted facts. Induction, conversely, is more adaptable to daily problem-solving, especially when dealing with incomplete information, yielding practical albeit not infallible conclusions. Comprehending these reasoning types is critical before advancing in research, just as grasping research ethics is indispensable, particularly when human participants are involved.</p>
										<p>Dawson (2015), discusses the complexity and personal nature of the intellectual discovery process in research, highlighting how inductive and deductive reasoning play crucial roles.</p>
 
									        <ul>
									            <li>
									                <em>Inductive Reasoning:</em> This involves starting from observations and drawing general conclusions to build models and theories, which depends on the data available, the subject being studied, and pre-existing knowledge and beliefs. It emphasizes how knowledge acquisition (epistemology) can either be generalized (positivism) or remain unique to the individual and situation (anti-positivism).
									            </li>
									            <li>
									                <em>Deductive Reasoning:</em> This starts with existing knowledge and understanding to predict observations that haven't been encountered before. It's shaped by one's theory of reality (ontology), personal understanding, and assumptions, leading to diverse deductions due to varying perspectives.
									            </li>
									        </ul>
									        <p>It also underscores the importance of ethical considerations in computer science and information systems projects, emphasizing that ethical issues are not limited to the medical or social sciences but also critically relevant in these fields.</p>
									        <p>Ethical considerations are highlighted across three primary dimensions: conducting research with integrity, managing participant involvement responsibly, and presenting results truthfully. Key points include the necessity of conducting research with honesty, respecting copyright, and intellectual property, being open to critique, and maintaining accuracy and honesty with all stakeholders involved.</p>
									        <p>Particularly when projects involve participants, especially vulnerable groups, ethical concerns intensify. The need for obtaining ethical clearance, respecting data protection laws (such as the UK's Data Protection Act of 1998), ensuring informed consent, and addressing confidentiality and security of data are paramount.</p>

									
									        <h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Reflective activity - Ethics in Computing:</h3>

										    <p><strong>Read Stahl et al (2016) and Bott (2014) Chapter 1.</strong></p>
										
										    <p><strong>In the Stahl et al (2016) paper, the authors state that “many of the authors involved in researching the ethics of computing remain wedded to their disciplinary traditions and fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders.”</strong></p>
										
										    <p><strong>Consider yourself as a relevant stakeholder, a Computing professional working for a company of your choice. Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature. Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry.</strong></p>
										
										    <p><strong>There is no strict word limit here but try to limit your submission to 2/3 pages (approximately 1000 words). You should include this in your e-portfolio, and you can submit it to your tutor for formative feedback. (If you wish to do that, please email them the link to the specific part of your GitHub e-portfolio.)</strong></p>


										    <p>As a Data Scientist at Attitude Group of Hotels in Mauritius, my role comprises of analysing complex datasets to enhance guest experiences across our nine diverse properties. Leveraging advanced analytical techniques, I provide insights that shape strategic decisions, from optimizing pricing models to personalizing guest services. My work significantly influences targeted marketing and operational efficiency, aligning with Attitude Group's commitment to sustainable, technology-driven hospitality. The company, known for its eco-friendly and authentic Mauritian hospitality, relies on data-driven strategies to maintain its competitive edge and uphold its reputation as a leader in the innovative hospitality sector.</p>
										
										    <p>One of the largest industries that caters primarily to people is the hospitality industry. Hotels, restaurants, and resorts have enormous databases that contain information about business operations as well as information about customers that visit the restaurant or resort. The collection of data in the hospitality sector begins at the reservation stage, where personal information ranging from generic data like names and phone numbers to sensitive data like bank account details is gathered. Moreover, nowadays, The Internet of Things (IoT) offers various opportunities to improve hospitality operations, most notably by enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction through massive data collection (Car et al., 2019). These businesses gather substantial volumes of personal data. While the industry has significantly benefited from online booking systems, mobile apps, and data analytics, this digital transformation entails the generation, collection, and processing of substantial data.</p>
										
										    <p>In the hospitality industry, guest privacy is a critical concern, particularly regarding the collection, use, and protection of guest data. Data is essential for creating guest profiles to enhance experiences, improve operational efficiency, and for marketing purposes, as noted by Mercan et al. (2020). However, the protection of this data is paramount. Unauthorized access and breaches pose risks of identity theft, financial loss, and can significantly harm the hotel's reputation. Therefore, implementing stringent security measures to protect guest data is not only a legal necessity but also crucial for maintaining customer trust and the integrity of the hotel's brand. Mishandling guest data in the hospitality industry can have severe repercussions, including legal penalties, erosion of guest trust, and detrimental effects on brand reputation. Implementing robust data protection measures, as highlighted in the HRS Column (2023), is both a legal mandate and an ethical obligation.</p>
										
										    <p>A common issue is having disjointed visitor profiles across multiple systems like PMS, CRM, and POS, leading to manual updates and security risks. Implementing a Central Data Management (CDM) system or a fully integrated software solution, to create unified, secure customer profiles and ensure real-time synchronization of data, enhancing protection against data breaches (Merlin, 2022). Also, ensuring guest privacy in the hospitality sector involves robust measures like data encryption and strict access controls. Conducting regular audits of data protection practices and educating staff on privacy's importance are critical (HRS Column, 2023). Additionally, managing how guest data is shared with third parties is equally vital. Ethical handling requires careful consideration when dealing with entities like travel agents and booking platforms to prevent unauthorized data access or misuse. This comprehensive approach to privacy strengthens trust and compliance with privacy standards.</p>
										
										    <p>Consent and transparency in data collection are crucial in the hospitality industry under GDPR's Articles 6 and 7. Guests must be clearly informed about what data is collected, why it's needed, and how it will be used, ensuring an understanding of their data's purpose. Crucially, guests should have the option to consent to or opt out of marketing communications, request data transfers, and exercise the “right to be forgotten.”, a practice that aligns with ethical standards and legal mandates. This approach not only adheres to legal requirements but also fosters trust and respect between hotels and their guests, reinforcing the importance of guest autonomy in data-related decisions.</p>
										
										    <p>Another primary concern is data security. According to a Trustwave cybersecurity report published in 2023, Nearly 31% of hospitality organisations have reported a data breach in their company’s history with the average cost of a breach at around US$3.4m. These events underscored the critical need for enhanced data security in the hospitality sector, leading to increased regulatory attention and the implementation of comprehensive security programs (PwC, 2016). The rise of technology in hotel operations, such as IT systems and IoT for guest services, has further accentuated the importance of robust cybersecurity measures. As hotels become more reliant on digital technologies to enhance guest experiences, the risk of data breaches also escalates, making the protection of guest information a paramount concern. This focus on data security is not just about safeguarding information; it's also about maintaining guest trust, which is directly linked to the industry's revenue and reputation. Consequently, the hotel industry has been compelled to strike a balance between leveraging technological advancements and ensuring the safety and confidentiality of guest data, a balance that is crucial for the industry's long-term success and customer loyalty (Shabani, 2020).</p>
										
										    <p>To ensure data security in the hospitality industry, several best practices are employed. These include encrypting payment card data, often coupled with two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access and identity theft. Employee training on data storage and handling is critical to mitigate insider attacks. Cybersecurity measures such as firewalls, traffic filters, and network monitoring are implemented to protect against online malware. Regular testing of computer systems by businesses is conducted to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity providers. Additionally, tracking data across various systems is crucial for monitoring and safeguarding the movement of sensitive information (Devi, 2023).</p>
										
										    <p>In the hotel industry, data security and guest privacy transcend mere compliance and risk management, intertwining with the economic benefits of using personal data for customer insights and personalized services. Developing a clear Vision that aligns economic goals with risk management and legal compliance is crucial. This Vision should reflect the unique attributes of the entity and consider all stakeholders' perspectives. A strategic plan based on this Vision can guide the establishment of necessary structures. Failures in data handling often stem from a lack of such a Vision. Hotel security and privacy professionals should evaluate if their organization has this Vision and collaborate with stakeholders to advance their strategies.</p>

									        <h3 style="color: #CFA7F6;">Reflection & Practical Use:</h3>
										<p>Reflecting on the interconnectedness of reasoning in research, ethical considerations, and the evolution of legal systems, one cannot help but appreciate the profound depth and intricacy inherent in the pursuit of knowledge and the administration of justice. The intellectual journey of research—whether it be in computer science or another field—requires a balance of inductive and deductive reasoning, a process deeply rooted in personal epistemology and ontology. It’s a delicate dance between what is observed and what is inferred, with each step guided by prior knowledge and the ethical imperative to conduct and present research with integrity.</p>	
									        <p>As a Mauritian, it is true that Mauritius exemplifies the rich tapestry of legal pluralism, where English common law and French civil law converge, mirroring the island's historical narrative. This legal hybridity symbolizes a broader global theme: the coexistence of tradition and modernity. Just as research reflects personal and societal values, so too does law embody the collective conscience and evolving norms.</p>
									        <p>Overall, these themes underscore the importance of context—historical, cultural, ethical—in shaping how we understand and govern our world. Whether it’s formulating a hypothesis or crafting a law, the underlying processes are not merely technical but are imbued with human values, judgments, and the perpetual quest for a fair and equitable society.</p>
